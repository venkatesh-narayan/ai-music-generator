Name of Project: Become Your Artist

Project Description: Provides means for users to generate background music similar to the artist of their choice (ex/ Eminem, Bruno Mars, etc.), and also provides a means for creating lyrical content by having a story generation feature: given a small input prompt generate a “story” from a model trained on the artist’s lyrics to represent content that they’d write about. Will also be able to “autotune” the user’s voice input and merge it with the background music if he/she decides to sing or rap on the generated beat. Includes some self-made GUI features as well, like a circular progress bar, frames, and rounded buttons.
